            An action role-playing video game that combines traditional western
            RPG mechanics and sci-fi story telling similar to Star Trek. Mass
            Effect is set within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183 where
            interstellar travel is possible through the use of mass transit
            devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built
            by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans. The term "Mass
            Effect" is defined as a form of mass-negating technology, allowing
            the creation of physics phenomena, like artificial gravity or FTL
            travel.

            Warframe is a free-to-play third-person action multiplayer game
            where you complete missions for parts, craft new weapons and gear,
            and repeat. The game doubles-down on engaging with gamers who
            thrives on progression and customization. In Warframe, players
            control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have
            awoken from centuries of suspended animation far into Earth's future
            to find themselves at war in the planetary system with different
            factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a variety
            of weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the
            game's missions use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates
            have included large open world areas similar to other massively
            multiplayer online games as well as some story-specific missions
            with fixed level design. The game includes elements of shooting and
            melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance
            their Tenno with improved gear.

          </p>
          <p>
            Satisfactory is a factory simulation game where you have creative
            freedom to decide how to build your automated machines. The player,
            a pioneer, is dropped onto an alien planet with a handful of tools
            and must harvest the planet's natural resources to construct
            increasingly complex factories for automating all resource needs.
            The goal is to produce a variety of resources to unlock the next
            tier, which will expand the scope of how you produce future
            resources. As factories become more complicated, problems will need
            to be solved and designs refactored, which will appeal to the
            engineering and programming minds.
