        CS50 has been fun and satisfying to part take in. It has provided me a
        solid software development foundation to build upon as I continue my
        software development journey. Besides my interest in coding, I enjoy
        playing Tennis, dabbling in various video games, and following along
        what's going on in the space industry. Click on the buttons below to
        learn more about me!
